Through we welcome participation from general clinic users and health workers.</p> <h4>Why are we doing this?</h4> <p>Practices of segregation and infection prevention vary across clinics, as do the buildings people work in. We aim to create dialogue around current design and practice, and explore potential for change, drawing on inspiration from past, present and future examples.</p> <h4>How can you be involved?</h4> <p>This is an interactive exhibition about design and the built environment - we would love to hear your views and your experiences.
