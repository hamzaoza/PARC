		<h4>What is this exhibition about?</h4>
		<p>Researchers at the University of York are exploring connections between day-to-day practices of preventing cross infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) clinics, and the design of the built environment. This exhibition aims to facilitate dialogue around current design and practice, and explore potential for change, drawing on past, present and future examples.
