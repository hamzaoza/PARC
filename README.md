# Pathways, Practices and Architectures

Researchers at the University of York are exploring connections between the day-to-day practices of preventing cross infection in cystic fibrosis clinics, and the design of the built environment.

### Why are they doing this?

Practices of segregation and infection prevention vary across clinics, as do the buildings people work in. We aim to create dialogue around current design and practice, and explore potential for change, drawing on inspiration from past, present and future examples.

### How can you be involved?

This is an interactive exhibition about design and the built environment - we would love to hear your views and your experiences. You can share your ideas by clicking the feedback button.
